**Niquests** is a simple, yet elegant, HTTP library. It is a drop-in replacement for **Requests**, which is under feature freeze.

Niquests, is the “**Safest**, **Fastest<sup>*</sup>**, **Easiest**, and **Most advanced**” Python HTTP Client. Production Ready!

✔️ **Try before you switch:** [See Multiplexed in Action](https://replit.com/@ahmedtahri4/Python#main.py)<br>

```python
>>> import niquests
>>> s = niquests.Session(resolver="doh+google://", multiplexed=True)
>>> r = s.get('https://pie.dev/basic-auth/user/pass', auth=('user', 'pass'))
>>> r.status_code
200
>>> r.headers['content-type']
'application/json; charset=utf8'
>>> r.oheaders.content_type.charset
'utf8'
>>> r.encoding
'utf-8'
>>> r.text
'{"authenticated": true, ...'
>>> r.json()
{'authenticated': True, ...}
>>> r
<Response HTTP/3 [200]>
>>> r.ocsp_verified
True
>>> r.conn_info.established_latency
datetime.timedelta(microseconds=38)
```
or using async/await! <small>you'll need to enclose the code within proper async function, see the docs for more.</small>
```python
import niquests
>>> s = niquests.AsyncSession(resolver="doh+google://")
>>> r = await s.get('https://pie.dev/basic-auth/user/pass', auth=('user', 'pass'), stream=True)
>>> r
<Response HTTP/3 [200]>
>>> await r.json()
{'authenticated': True, ...}
```

Niquests allows you to send HTTP requests extremely easily. There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your `PUT` & `POST` data — just use the `json` method!

## Why did we pursue this?

For many years now, **Requests** has been frozen. Being left in a vegetative state and not evolving, this blocked millions of developers from using more advanced features.

We don't have to reinvent the wheel all over again, HTTP client **Requests** is well established and
really pleasant in its usage. We believe that **Requests** has the most inclusive and developer friendly interfaces.
We intend to keep it that way. As long as we can, long live Niquests!

How about a nice refresher with a mere `CTRL+H` _import requests_ **to** _import niquests as requests_ ?
